This miniature was designed and commissioned by Narcissa Niblack Thorne, a wealthy Chicago socialite, in the 1930s. Thorne designed extensive series of dioramas that depicted domestic interiors from a wide range of hisotrical periods in a miniature scale of one inch to one foot. That means that in each of her rooms, everythign is exactly 1/12 the size it would be in real life. This room is from her last series of miniatures, which all depicted American rooms from the 17th to the 20th centuries. This room is based on the kitchen of the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.
