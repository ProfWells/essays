Narcissa Niblack Thorne was a wealthy Chicago socialite who produced an extensive series of dioramas that depicted domestic interiors from a wide range of hisotrical periods in a miniature scale of one inch to one foot. That means that in each of her rooms, everythign is exactly 1/12 the size it would be in real life. This room is from her last series of miniatures, which all depicted American rooms from the 17th to the 20th centuries. Like many miniatures in this series, it is based on a specific room, the kitchen of the Governor's Palace in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia.

Thorne used a number of techniques to make her rooms appear uncannily realistic and lived in. Light steams in from doorways and windows, the result of electric bulbs hidden behind the dioramas. Doorways also reveal adjacent rooms and windows look out onto gardens, street scenes and landscapes that make it appear that an entire miniature world extends beyond the room itself. Within each room, little vignettes are arranged to evoke human inhabitants who seem to have just left. Childrens toys left on the floor, a tea set laid out on a table, or writing implements on a desk, all suggest that real (miniature) people could reappear at any moment.

Sometimes Thorne's rooms were so homey and lifelike, they seemed less like historical rooms and more like contemporary rooms decorated in a period style. This Cape Cod Living Room and New England Bedroom are especially similar to 1930s rooms decorated in colonial revival styles.
